x has 56 subsets w/ 3 elements |x| = ?
(|x| \ 3) = 56
|x|! / (|x|-3)!3!
|x|! / (|x|-3)! = 336
let |x| = n 
n!/(n-3)! = n(n-1)(n-2) = 336

	LOGIC Chapter
2.1
Logic is a systematic way of thinking that allows us to parse the 
meanings of sentences to deduce new info from old info.

defn: A statement is sentence or math expression that is either
definietly true or definitely false

ex: 
Statment Q
if a circle has a radius r then its area is pi*r^2 square units, true

Statement P
every even number is divisible by 2, true 

5=2, false

sqrt(2) is not in all real numbers, false

P: if an integer x is a multiple of 6, then x is even.
P(x): if an integer x is a multiple of 6, then..
R(x,y,z):

Ex: Goldbach Conjecture 
    S: every even integer greater than 2 is a sum of two prime numbers
    4=2+2 6=3+3 8=5+3 24=13+11

Are the following statements?
-if they are state wether the are true or false

1)Every even integer is a real number, true all integers are real numbers
2)Set Z and N, False

2.2
	And(intersection), Or(union), Not

Waitress: you want soup or salad? Me: Yes!

-Statements can be combined with the word "Or"
-In math, the statement "P or Q"
means P is true,Q is true, or both P and Q are true

Inclusive Or
"P Or Q" can be written as 
"P V Q"

Truth Table
P |Q  |P V Q
T | T | T
T | F | T
F | T | T
F | F | F

Exclusive Or
if exactly one of P and Q is true then we say Either P Or Q
P or Q, but not both

"P and Q" <- true if both P is true and Q is true at the same time.

A = upside down V = and

P | Q | P A Q
T | T | T
T | F | F
F | T | F
F | F | F

We use the symbol ~ to stand for the words "it's not true that" so 
in other words not P means "its not true that P"
or ~P means Not P. 

P | ~P
T | F
F | T

ex
P: 2 is even 
~P: 2 is not even
