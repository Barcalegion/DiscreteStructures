V- for every
E(backwords) there exists a
but is like and
V- x in S, Q(x) equals (x in S) -> Q(x)

2.9
Ex: translate into symbolic language 
for every positive number epsilon there is a positive number M for which 
|f(x)-b| < epsilon, wherever x>M

V- epsilon > 0, E(backwords) M > 0, (x>M)->|f(x)-b|<epsilon

2.10 (Negations)
	
	deMorgans laws
-(p and Q) = -p or -q
-(p or q) = -p and -q

Let p(x) be a statement x is even 
V- in S, P(x)	p(x_1) = true p(x_2) = true p(x_3) = true
-(V- x in S, P(x)) = E(backwords) x in S, -P(x)
		opposite of all p(x_i) is true is 
		 E(backwards) p(x_i) that is false
-(E(backwords) x in S, P(x)) = V- x in S, -P(x)
												p(x)
negate the following statement r: the square of every real number is non negative [(V- x in R , x^2 >=0) 
											E(backwords) x in R, x^2 < 0
S: Any real number x has a cube root y
-(Vx in R, E(backwords) y in R, y^3=x)

there exits a number x where y^3 /= x for all y
E(backwords) x in R, V-y in R, y^3 /= x

E(backwords) x in R, -(E(backwords)y in R,y^3=x))

-(P->Q) = P and -Q

1) if [x is prime] then [sqrt(x) is not a rational number]
negation: x is prime and sqrt(x) is a rational number

2) for every positive number epsilon there is positive number delta such that |x - a | < epsilon implies |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon
	V- epsilon > 0, E(backwords) delta > 0, |x-a|<delta -> |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon
	negation: E(backword) epsilon > 0, V- delta > 0, |x-a|<delta and |f(x)-f(a)|>= epsilon

3) if x is rational number and x /= 0 then tan(x) is not a rational number.
	(x in Q) and (x/=0) -> tan(x) is not in Q
	negation x in Q and x/=0 and tan(x) in Q
