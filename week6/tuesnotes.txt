factorial(23);

binomial(52,13)

a = factorial(10)
b = factorial(3)
c = factorial(10-3)

a/(b*c)

ex: find all ordered list of size 3 of the set {r,o,t,f,l}
A = ["r","o","t","l","f"]
arrangements(A,3).list()

ways to get 73 cents from pennies, nickles and dimes
A=[1,5,10]
b = WeightedIntegerVectors(73,A)

b.cardinality()

Logic Conditional Statements (if-then statements)
	R: if the integer A is a multiple of six, then A is even.
	
	P:The integer A is a multiple of six
	Q:A is even
	R:If P, then Q

	P->Q, "p implies Q" 
	
	truth table
	P | Q | P->Q | P: if push button, then Q: Win money
	T | F | F    | 
	F | T | T    | T because we dont know what happens if we dont push the button
	T | T | T    |
	F | F | T    | T because we dont know what happens if we dont push the button

Ex: For a function to be continuous it is sufficient that it is differentiable

	if a function is differentiable
	then it is continuous

Ex: A function is rational if it is a polynomial

	if a function is a polynomial
	then it is rational

A biconditional statement is of the form 
	P<->Q	"P implies Q and Q implies P"
	"P if and only if Q" or "Q if and only if P" Abb("P iff Q")

The converse of P->Q is Q->P

Ex: Are converses always true 
    if the original statement is true?
	No!

If a convserse of a true statement is also true, then it can be written as a biconditional statement

Truth Table
P | Q | P->Q | Q->P | P<->Q
T | T |  T   |   T  |   T
T | F |  F   |   T  |   F
F | T |  T   |   F  |   F
F | F |  T   |   T  |   T

Ex: If A is an element of Rational #'s then 5A is an element of Rational #'s and if 5A is an element of Rational #'s then A is an element of Rational #'s 
	P iff Q 

	A is an element of Q and 5A is an element of Q
