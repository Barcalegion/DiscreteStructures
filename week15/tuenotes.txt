theorems - conditional statements (if then) premise and conclusion
Topic 5
proofs 
- Propositions collory, opposite paraody, prime numbers, closure properties fact 4.1
- Direct proofs
- Contrapositive(important)
- Proof by Contradiction
- if, then statement(conditional statements, theorems are written this way)
- Bi-conditional Statements(if and only if, converse is true)
- Contrapositives of P->Q = ~Q->~P are equivalent statements.
- Converse, is the converse of a statement true? not always true. is contrapositive if so. p->q q->p
- Relations, (diagrams) and sets. are reflexive, symmetric, transitive. familarize definitions.
- equivilance relations, equivalence Classes, Isomorphisms, Isomorphic f(x) = x
- composition of functions
- Inverse
- pigeon-hole Principle. equal to or more holes than pigeons then it can be injective.
- sequences and series recursive notation(fibanocci), closed formulas/explicit formulas
- sum of arithmetics sum of geometrics.
